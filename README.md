# ImageClassificationApp_first

## What is Image Classification ?
The task of identifying what an image represents is called Image Classification. An image classification model is trained to recognize various classes of images.

## About This App 
This is an Image Classification App developed in Android Studio using Kotlin language. It uses pre-trained TensorFlow Lite model to classify different images. This model accepts an input of 224x224 pixels image.
<br>The model that I have used in this app is available here [mobilenet_v1_1.0_224_quant_and_labels](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/examples/image_classification/overview).
